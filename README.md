Algorithm Challenge #16 – Print All 3-Letter Words (AAA to ZZZ)
--
🧮 Problem Description
-
This program generates and prints every possible 3-letter combination made from uppercase English letters (A to Z).

The algorithm uses three nested loops, each responsible for one letter of the word:

1️⃣ First loop → controls the first letter

2️⃣ Second loop → controls the second letter

3️⃣ Third loop → controls the third letter

This produces all combinations from AAA → AAB → ... → ZZX → ZZY → ZZZ, totaling 17,576 words. 

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
Working with ASCII character ranges
Using nested loops efficiently
Generating combinatorial sequences
Pattern construction using characters
Clean and modular C++ function design

🧩 Example Output
-
AAA

AAB

AAC

...

ZZX

ZZY

ZZZ


📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: print_words_AAA_to_ZZZ.cpp

Challenge Number: #11

💬 Notes
-
This challenge is excellent for learning how to systematically generate combinations.
It also strengthens logical thinking and provides a foundation for more advanced combinatorial algorithms.
